  "description": "OUTDATED: USE REPLAY INSTEAD.\r\n\r\n Lets you view your replay of your best attempt or score on a song. Replays can be sped up or slowed down and paired with death replays (the replays that show on the level failed screen), this can be an excellent practice tool. View your death replay and slow it down a lot to see exactly why you died.\r\n\r\nFull replay will still take a while but I am definitely making progress.\r\n\r\nMy Patreon (If you join then you get some perks): https://www.patreon.com/henwill8?fan_landing=true",
